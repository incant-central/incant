Incant sets out to take the simple idea of state machine orchestration and bring it to the command-line.

Move away from arcane shell incantations and write small single purpose functions for Node.js and utilize incant's built-in state machine orchestration notation to pull together everything you need.

Incant is built atop a new data notation called PDN. PDN is a data notation which aims to be ergonomic and friendly enough that it can be surfaced all the way to the command-line. This allows for an entirely new approach to the command-line interface. Incant uses PDN notation, extended by Sota, to provide a truly unique command-line experience that you're sure to fall in love with. Once you've seen the light, you'll never want to go back.

There's so much to go over, but Incant is still in an early alpha phase. Stay tuned!
