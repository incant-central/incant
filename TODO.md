## Pending work for alpha release

- [x] sota based workflow orchestration
- [x] pdn support for target data loader
- [x] dry run support
- [ ] strengthen streaming output support - some commands are running silently!
- [ ] refine reported and output modes
- [ ] recursive submachine support - non-trivial but doable
- [ ] many many more unit tests
- [ ] pdn support for config (via answers)
- [ ] update all targets documentation
- [ ] remove sugarmerge from answers? fork? optional merge fn? seems orthogonal now... adds undue complexity
- [ ] bake-in dottle support? at least kill remaining dottle bugs - parallel branch issue is show stopper.
- [ ] resolve fn targets at compile time?
- [ ] allow shellspec to support "other" choice override
- [ ] new logo! re-brand opportunity
- [ ] AWS Lambda invokations
