## Overview

Incant takes the concept of task orchestration via state machines and surfaces it to the command-line. It enables you, the author of the next great CLI tool, to take many small single-purpose functions and to safely compose them into complex but reliable workflows using a succint declarative syntax.

Use Incant to build common tooling for your team/users and to reduce complex workflows into reliable tasks and which are simple to operate on.
