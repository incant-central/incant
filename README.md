> ### Here be dragons!
> **Please note that Incant is still in alpha testing and is undergoing heavy development.**
> The basics are all working but there are lots of kinks to work out and breaking changes are sure to land often. Don't let that discourage you from playing around with it in the meantime, but you have been warned. Expect the first stable beta release in early 2020.

## Overview

Incant takes the concept of task orchestration via state machines and surfaces it to the command-line. It enables you, the author of the next great CLI tool, to take many small single-purpose functions and to safely compose them into complex but reliable workflows using a succint declarative syntax.

Use Incant to build common tooling for your team/users and to reduce complex workflows into reliable tasks and which are simple to operate on.
